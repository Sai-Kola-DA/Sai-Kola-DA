## Hi there 👋
I’m a data professional with 4+ years of experience at Tata Consultancy Services, where I supported global clients in the retail, FMCG, and supply chain sectors - including Mars, SuperValu, and UNFI. 
I recently completed a Master’s in Data Science in the UK, and I’m now looking to grow into a Data Analyst and Engineering role where I can apply my skills to solve practical, high-impact problems.

𝐖𝐡𝐚𝐭 𝐈’𝐦 𝐋𝐨𝐨𝐤𝐢𝐧𝐠 𝐅𝐨𝐫
I'm keen to join a team where I can continue building data pipelines, learning cloud platforms, and helping real users access clean, useful data. I value transparency, practical problem-solving, and environments where people grow together.

If you're hiring for a Mid-Level Data Analyst/Junior Senior Data Analyst role - or even if you just want to talk data - I’d love to connect. I’m fully eligible to work in the UK on a dependent spouse visa and available to start immediately.
